abstract = {Space-borne formaldehyde (HCHO) column measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), with 13 x 24 km(2) nadir footprint and daily global coverage, provide new constraints on the spatial distribution of biogenic isoprene emission from North America. OMI HCHO columns for June-August 2006 are consistent with measurements from the earlier GOME satellite sensor (1996-2001) but OMI is 2-14{\%} lower. The spatial distribution of OMI HCHO columns follows that of isoprene emission; anthropogenic hydrocarbon emissions are undetectable except in Houston. We develop updated relationships between HCHO columns and isoprene emission from a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), and use these to infer top-down constraints on isoprene emissions from the OMI data. We compare the OMI-derived emissions to a state-of-science bottom-up isoprene emission inventory (MEGAN) driven by two land cover databases, and use the results to optimize the MEGAN emission factors (EFs) for broadleaf trees (the main isoprene source). The OMI-derived isoprene emissions in North America (June-August 2006) with 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution are spatially consistent with MEGAN (R-2 = 0.48-0.68) but are lower (by 4-25{\%} on average). MEGAN overestimates emissions in the Ozarks and the Upper South. A better fit to OMI (R-2 = 0.73) is obtained in MEGAN by using a uniform isoprene EF from broadleaf trees rather than variable EFs. Thus MEGAN may overestimate emissions in areas where it specifies particularly high EFs. Within-canopy isoprene oxidation may also lead to significant differences between the effective isoprene emission to the atmosphere seen by OMI and the actual isoprene emission determined by MEGAN.},

abstract = {Negative trends of carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations are observed in the recent decade by both surface measurements and satellite retrievals over many regions, but they are not well explained by current emission inventories. Here, we attribute the observed CO concentration decline with an atmospheric inversion that simultaneously optimizes the two main CO sources (surface emissions and atmospheric hydrocarbon oxidations) and the main CO sink (atmospheric hydroxyl radical OH oxidation) by assimilating observations of CO and other chemically related tracers. Satellite CO column retrievals from Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), version 6, and surface in-situ measurements of methane and methyl-chloroform mole fractions are assimilated jointly for the period of 2002–2011. Compared to the prior simulation, the optimized CO concentrations show better agreement with independent surface in-situ measurements in terms of both distributions and trends. At the global scale, the atmospheric inversion primarily interprets the CO concentration decline as a decrease in the CO emissions, and finds noticeable trends neither in the chemical oxidation sources of CO, nor in the OH concentrations that regulate CO sinks. The latitudinal comparison of the model state with independent formaldehyde (CH2O) columns retrieved from the Ozone Measurement Instrument (OMI) confirms the absence of large-scale trends in the atmospheric source of CO. The global CO emission decreased by 17{\%} during the decade, more than twice the negative trend estimated by emission inventories. The spatial distribution of the inferred decrease of CO emissions indicates contributions from both a decrease in fossil- and bio-fuel emissions over Europe, the USA and Asia, and from a decrease in biomass burning emissions in South America, Indonesia, Australia and Boreal regions. An emission decrease of 2{\%} yr−1 is inferred in China, one of the main emitting regions, in contradiction with the bottom-up inventories that report an increase of 2{\%} yr−1 during the study period. A large decrease in CO emission factors due to technology improvements would outweigh the increase of carbon fuel combustions and may explain the observed decrease. In Africa, instead of the negative trend (1{\%} yr−1) reported by CO emission inventories mainly contributed by biomass burning, a positive trend (1.5{\%} yr−1) is found by the atmospheric inversion, suggesting different trends between satellite-detected burned areas and CO emissions.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of biogenic emissions on carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), with simulations using two different biogenic emission inventories for isoprene and monoterpenes. Results from four atmospheric chemistry models are compared to continuous long-term ground-based CO and HCHO column measurements at the SH Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) sites, the satellite measurement of tropospheric CO columns from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), and in situ surface CO measurements from across the SH, representing a subset of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Global Monitoring Division (NOAA GMD) network. Simulated mean model CO using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (v2.1) computed in the frame work of the Land Community Model (CLM-MEGANv2.1) inventory is in better agreement with both column and surface observations than simulations adopting the emission inventory generated from the LPJ-GUESS dynamical vegetation model framework, which markedly underestimate measured column and surface CO at most sites. Differences in biogenic emissions cause large differences in CO in the source regions which propagate to the remote SH. Significant inter-model differences exist in modelled column and surface CO, and secondary production of CO dominates these inter-model differences, due mainly to differences in the models' oxidation schemes for volatile organic compounds, predominantly isoprene oxidation. While biogenic emissions are a significant factor in modelling SH CO, inter-model differences pose an additional challenge to constrain these emissions. Corresponding comparisons of HCHO columns at two SH mid-latitude sites reveal that all models significantly underestimate the observed values by approximately a factor of 2. There is a much smaller impact on HCHO of the significantly different biogenic emissions in remote regions, compared to the source regions. Decreased biogenic emissions cause decreased CO export to remote regions, which leads to increased OH; this in turn results in increased HCHO production through methane oxidation. In agreement with earlier studies, we corroborate that significant HCHO sources are likely missing in the models in the remote SH.},

We present seven years (1995{\&}{\#}8211;2001) of HCHO column data for North America from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), and show that the general seasonal and interannual variability of these data is consistent with knowledge of isoprene emission. There are some significant regional discrepancies with the seasonal patterns predicted from current isoprene emission models, and we suggest that these may reflect flaws in the models. The interannual variability of HCHO columns observed by GOME appears to follow the interannual variability of surface temperature, as expected from current isoprene emission models.},

abstract = {For the first time, carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) satellite retrievals are used together with methane (CH4) and methyl choloroform (CH3CCl3 or MCF) surface measurements in an advanced inversion system. The CO and HCHO are respectively from the MOPITT and OMI instruments. The multi-species and multi-satellite dataset inversion is done for the 2005–2010 period. The robustness of our results is evaluated by comparing our posterior-modeled concentrations with several sets of independent measurements of atmospheric mixing ratios. The inversion leads to significant changes from the prior to the posterior, in terms of magnitude and seasonality of the CO and CH4 surface fluxes and of the HCHO production by non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). The latter is significantly decreased, indicating an overestimation of the biogenic NMVOC emissions, such as isoprene, in the GEIA inventory. CO and CH4 surface emissions are increased by the inversion, from 1037 to 1394 TgCO and from 489 to 529 TgCH4 on average for the 2005–2010 period. CH4 emissions present significant interannual variability and a joint CO-CH4 fluxes analysis reveals that tropical biomass burning probably played a role in the recent increase of atmospheric methane.},

abstract = {Only very few long-term trends of formaldehyde (HCHO) exist. Furthermore, many uncertainties remain as to its diurnal cycle, representing a large short-term variability superimposed on seasonal and inter-annual variations that should be accounted for when comparing ground-based observations to e.g., model results. In this study, we derive a multi-decadal time series (January 1988–June 2015) of HCHO total columns from ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) solar spectra recorded at the high-altitude station of Jungfraujoch (Swiss Alps, 46.5° N, 8.0° E, 3580 m a.s.l.), allowing for the characterization of the mid-latitudinal atmosphere for background conditions. First we investigate the HCHO diurnal variation, peaking around noontime and mainly driven by the intra-day insolation modulation and methane (CH4) oxidation. We also characterize quantitatively the diurnal cycles by adjusting a parametric model to the observations, which links the daytime to the HCHO columns according to the monthly intra-day regimes. It is then employed to scale all the individual FTIR measurements on a given daytime in order to remove the effect of the intra-day modulation for improving the trend determination and the comparison with HCHO columns simulated by the state-of-the-art chemical transport model GEOS-Chem v9-02. Such a parametric model will be useful to scale the Jungfraujoch HCHO columns on satellite overpass times in the framework of future calibration/validation efforts of space borne sensors. GEOS-Chem sensitivity tests suggest then that the seasonal and inter-annual HCHO column variations above Jungfraujoch are predominantly led by the atmospheric CH4 oxidation, with a maximum contribution of 25 {\%} from the anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compound precursors during wintertime. Finally, trend analysis of the so-scaled 27 year FTIR time series reveals a long-term evolution of the HCHO columns in the remote troposphere to be related with the atmospheric CH4 fluctuations and the short-term OH variability: +2.9 {\%} yr−1 between 1988 and 1995, −3.7 {\%} yr−1 over 1996–2002 and +0.8 {\%} yr−1 from 2003 onwards.},

The version of the algorithm described here includes relevant changes with respect to the operational one, including differences in the reference spectra for H2CO, the fit of O2–O2 collisional complex, updates in the high-resolution solar reference spectrum, the use of a model reference sector over the remote Pacific Ocean to normalize the retrievals, an updated air mass factor (AMF) calculation scheme, and the inclusion of scattering weights and vertical H2CO profile in the level 2 products. The setup of the retrieval is discussed in detail. We compare the results of the updated retrieval with the results from the previous SAO H2CO retrieval. The improvement in the slant column fit increases the temporal stability of the retrieval and slightly reduces the noise. The change in the AMF calculation has increased the AMFs by 20{\%}, mainly due to the consideration of the radiative cloud fraction. Typical values for retrieved vertical columns are between 4 × 1015 and 4 × 1016 molecules cm−2, with typical fitting uncertainties ranging between 45 and 100{\%}. In high-concentration regions the errors are usually reduced to 30{\%}. The detection limit is estimated at 1 × 1016 molecules cm−2.},

abstract = {This paper describes the existence of temperature threshold in isoprene emission from tropical trees for the first time. Isoprene emission capacity of Ficus virgata leaves kept outdoors were measured over a period of 20 d in the wintertime. When the plants experienced the low temperature below 12 °C in the daytime, isoprene emission was completely suppressed, and re-activated by elevated temperature above the threshold of 12 °C. Photosynthesis is also decreased similarly, but too much smaller extent compared to the reduction observed for isoprene emission. The cut off level of accumulated temperature to shut off the isoprene emission was roughly estimated to be 300 degree/d. The shut off in the isoprene emission by the low temperature was confirmed experimentally by use of phytotron with tropical trees of F. virgata and F. septica. Isoprene emission of both species ceased at 12 °C, and re-activated by raising the temperature above the threshold level. Photosynthesis was lowered slightly as was the case for the field observation, and no close association between photosynthesis and isoprene emission was noted. The expression of isoprene synthase gene showed much greater variation after exposure to the cold temperature compared to those involved in photosynthesis. These observations therefore suggested the existence of putative direct connection between perception of temperature and isoprene emission in tropical trees, which may merit further investigation to estimate the net output of isoprene from subtropical or tropical forest.},

abstract = {After methane, ethane is the most abundant hydrocarbon in the remote atmosphere. It is a precursor to tropospheric ozone and it influences the atmosphere/'s oxidative capacity through its reaction with the hydroxyl radical, ethane/'s primary atmospheric sink. Here we present the longest continuous record of global atmospheric ethane levels. We show that global ethane emission rates decreased from 14.3 to 11.3 teragrams per year, or by 21 per cent, from 1984 to 2010. We attribute this to decreasing fugitive emissions from ethane/'s fossil fuel source—most probably decreased venting and flaring of natural gas in oil fields—rather than a decline in its other major sources, biofuel use and biomass burning. Ethane/'s major emission sources are shared with methane, and recent studies have disagreed on whether reduced fossil fuel or microbial emissions have caused methane/'s atmospheric growth rate to slow. Our findings suggest that reduced fugitive fossil fuel emissions account for at least 10-21 teragrams per year (30-70 per cent) of the decrease in methane/'s global emissions, significantly contributing to methane/'s slowing atmospheric growth rate since the mid-1980s.},

abstract = {[1] We perform Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on 12 years of global GOME and SCIAMACHY formaldehyde (HCHO) column observations to determine the most significant spatial and temporal HCHO variations. In most regions, we find that HCHO variability is predominantly driven by seasonal variations of biogenic emissions and biomass burning. However, unusually low HCHO columns are consistently observed over the Amazon rainforest during the transition from the wet-to-dry seasons. We use MODIS leaf area and enhanced vegetation indices, to show variations in vegetation are consistent with the observed decrease in HCHO during this period (correlations of 0.69 and 0.67, respectively). Based on this evidence, we suggest isoprene emitting vegetation experience widespread leaf flushing (new leaf growth) prior to the dry season, resulting in a large-scale annual shutdown of Amazonian isoprene emissions.

abstract = {This review summarizes recent research in Australia on: (i) climate and geophysical trends over the last few decades; (ii) projections for climate change in the 21st century; (iii) predicted impacts from modelling studies on particular ecosystems and native species; and (iv) ecological effects that have apparently occurred as a response to recent warming. Consistent with global trends, Australia has warmed {\~{}} 0.8 Њ C over the last century with minimum temperatures warming faster than maxima. There have been significant regional trends in rainfall with the northern, eastern and southern parts of the continent receiving greater rainfall and the western region receiving less. Higher rainfall has been associated with an increase in the number of rain days and heavy rainfall events. Sea surface temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef have increased and are associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of coral bleaching and mortality. Sea level rises in Australia have been regionally variable, and considerably less than the global average. Snow cover and duration have declined significantly at some sites in the Snowy Mountains. CSIRO projections for future climatic changes indicate increases in annual average temperatures of 0.4–2.0 Њ C by 2030 (relative to 1990) and 1.0–6.0 Њ C by 2070. Considerable uncertainty remains as to future changes in rainfall, El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation events and tropical cyclone activity. Overall increases in potential evaporation over much of the continent are predicted as well as continued reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover. Future changes in temperature and rainfall are predicted to have significant impacts on most vegetation types that have been modelled to date, although the interactive effect of continuing increases in atmospheric CO 2 has not been incorporated into most modelling studies. Elevated CO 2 will most likely mitigate some of the impacts of climate change by reducing water stress. Future impacts on particular ecosystems include increased forest growth, alterations in competitive regimes between C3 and C4 grasses, increasing encroachment of woody shrubs into arid and semiarid rangelands, continued incursion of mangrove communities into freshwater wetlands, increasing frequency of coral bleaching, and establishment of woody species at increasingly higher elevations in the alpine zone. Modelling of potential impacts on specific Australian taxa using bioclimatic analysis programs such as BIOCLIM consistently predicts contraction and/or fragmentation of species' current ranges. The bioclimates of some species of plants and vertebrates are predicted to disappear entirely with as little as 0.5–1.0 Њ C of warming. Australia lacks the long-term datasets and tradition of phenological monitoring that have allowed the detection of climate-change-related trends in the Northern Hemisphere. Long-term changes in Australian vegetation can be mostly attributed to alterations in fire regimes, clearing and grazing, but some trends, such as encroachment of rainforest into eucalypt woodlands, and establishment of trees in subalpine meadows probably have a climatic component. Shifts in species distributions toward the south (bats, birds), upward in elevation (alpine mammals) or along changing rainfall contours (birds, semiarid reptiles), have recently been documented and offer circumstantial evidence that temperature and rainfall trends are already affecting geographic ranges. Future research directions suggested include giving more emphasis to the study of climatic impacts and understanding the factors that control species distributions, incorporating the effects of elevated CO 2 into climatic modelling for vegetation and selecting suitable species as indicators of climate-induced change.},

@article{Crutzen1999,
abstract = {We present a largely tutorial overview of the main processes that influence the photochemistry of the background troposphere. This is mostly driven by the photolysis of ozone by solar ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than about 340 nm, resulting in production of excited O(1D) atoms, whose reaction with water vapor produces OH radicals. In the background atmosphere the OH radicals mostly react with CO, and with CH4 and some of its oxidation products, which in turn are oxidized by OH. Depending on the availability of NOx catalysts, ozone may be produced or destroyed in amounts that are much greater than the downward flux of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere. Using the 3D chemical-transport model MATCH, global distributions and budget analyses are presented for tropospheric O3, CH4, CO, and the “odd hydrogen” compounds OH, HO2 and H2O2. We show that OH is present in maximum concentrations in the tropics, and that most of the chemical breakdown of CO and CH4 also occurs in equatorial regions. We also split the troposphere into continental and marine regions, and show that there is a tremendous difference in photochemical O3 and OH production for these regions, much larger than the difference between the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere. Finally, we show the results from a numerical simulation in which we reduced the amount of ozone in the model stratosphere by a factor of 10 (which in turn reduced the flux of O3 into the troposphere by about the same factor). Nevertheless, for summer conditions, model calculated O3 mixing ratios below 5 km in the mid to high latitudes were about 70–90{\%} as high as those calculated with the full downward flux of ozone from the stratosphere. This indicates that, at least under these conditions, O3 concentrations in the lower troposphere are largely controlled by in situ photochemistry, with only a secondary influence from stratospheric influx.},

abstract = {Seasonally-resolved upper tropospheric profiles of formaldehyde (HCHO) observed by the ACE Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on a near-global scale are presented for the time period from March 2004 to November 2006. Large upper tropospheric HCHO mixing ratios ({\textgreater} 150 pptv) are observed during the growing season of the terrestrial biosphere in the Northern Hemisphere and during the biomass burning season in the Southern Hemisphere. The total errors estimated for the retrieved mixing ratios range from 30 to 40{\%} in the upper troposphere and increase in the lower stratosphere. The sampled HCHO concentrations are in satisfactory agreement with previous aircraft and satellite observations with a negative bias ({\textless} 25{\%}) within observation errors. An overview of the seasonal cycle of the upper tropospheric HCHO is given for different latitudes, with a particular focus on mid-to-high latitudes that are well sampled by the observations. A maximum is observed during summer, i.e. during the growing season, in the northern mid- and high latitudes. The influence of biomass burning is visible in HCHO upper tropospheric concentrations during the September-to-October period in the southern tropics and subtropics. Comparisons with two state-of-the-art models (GEOS-Chem and LMDz-INCA) show that the models capture well the seasonal variations observed in the Northern Hemisphere (correlation {\textgreater} 0.9). Both models underestimate the summer maximum over Europe and Russia and differences in the emissions used for North America result in a good reproduction of the summer maximum by GEOS-Chem but in an underestimate by LMDz-INCA. Globally, GEOS-Chem reproduces well the observations on average over one year but has some difficulties in reproducing the spatial variability of the observations. LMDz-INCA shows significant bias in the Southern Hemisphere, perhaps related to an underestimation of methane, but better reproduces the temporal and spatial variations. The differences between the models underline the large uncertainties that remain in the emissions of HCHO precursors.},

abstract = {We use 2005-2009 satellite observations of formaldehyde (HCHO) columns from the OMI instrument to infer biogenic isoprene emissions at monthly 1 × 1° resolution over the African continent. Our work includes new approaches to remove biomass burning influences using OMI absorbing aerosol optical depth data (to account for transport of fire plumes) and anthropogenic influences using AATSR satellite data for persistent small-flame fires (gas flaring). The resulting biogenic HCHO columns ($\Omega$HCHO) from OMI follow closely the distribution of vegetation patterns in Africa. We infer isoprene emission (EISOP) from the local sensitivity S = $\Delta$$\Omega$HCHO / $\Delta$EISOP derived with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model using two alternate isoprene oxidation mechanisms, and verify the validity of this approach using AMMA aircraft observations over West Africa and a longitudinal transect across central Africa. Displacement error (smearing) is diagnosed by anomalously high values of S and the corresponding data are removed. We find significant sensitivity of S to NOx under low-NOx conditions that we fit to a linear function of tropospheric column NO2. We estimate a 40{\%} error in our inferred isoprene emissions under high-NOx conditions and 40-90{\%} under low-NOx conditions. Our results suggest that isoprene emission from the central African rainforest is much lower than estimated by the state-of-the-science MEGAN inventory.},

abstract = {Long-term total column measurements of formaldehyde (HCHO) covering a 12 year period from 1992 to 2004 are reported from spectra recorded with a high-resolution Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) using the sun as a light source at a Southern Hemisphere site (Lauder, New Zealand). The ambient HCHO concentrations at this rural location are often at background levels ({\textless}250 ppt) typical for remote marine environments. Due to these low values of HCHO, which are often at or below the detection limit of standard techniques, a method of analysis has been developed that successfully produces HCHO columns with sufficient sensitivity throughout the whole season. The HCHO column over Lauder was found to have a strong seasonal cycle (±50{\%}), with a mean column of 4.2×10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}15{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} molecules cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, the maximum occurring in the summer. A simple box model of CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} oxidation reproduces the seasonal cycle, but significantly underestimates the maximum HCHO ground concentrations deduced from the column observations, particularly in summer. This implies the existence of a significant source of HCHO that cannot be explained by oxidation of CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} alone. The ground-based FTS column data compares well with collocated HCHO column measurements from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite instrument (r{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}=0.65, mean bias=10{\%}, n=48).},

abstract = {We have made extensive measurements of total column OCS by ground-based high-resolution solar Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy from two southern hemisphere sites to complement earlier measurements in the northern hemisphere and to investigate the interhemispheric ratio, variability, and seasonal cycles of OCS in the atmosphere. The measurements were made at Lauder, New Zealand (45.0 degrees S, 169.7 degrees E, 370 m asl, 537 spectra March 1993 through April 1997), and Wollongong, Australia (34.45 degrees S, 150.88 degrees E 30 m asl, 358 spectra May 1996 through April 1997). The annual mean column amounts are 9.15 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) above Lauder and 9.84 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) above Wollongong, corresponding to tropospheric mixing ratios of 480 and 490 parts per trillion by volume, respectively, with the assumed mixing ratio vertical profiles. The secular trend in total column OCS is less than 1{\%} per year. Variability of all measurements about the means implies an atmospheric lifetime for OCS of at least 2.8 years. Comparison with earlier measurements in the northern hemisphere yields a north/south interhemispheric ratio in the range 1.1-1.2. There are peak-to-peak apparent annual cycles in total column OCS of 6{\%} at Lauder and 18{\%} at Wollongong with a late summer maximum. Seasonal tropopause height variation accounts for a 5-6{\%} amplitude, and the remainder of the amplitude in Wollongong is assumed to be due to changes in the tropospheric mixing ratio.},

abstract = {When intercomparing measurements made by remote sounders, it is necessary to make due allowance for the differing characteristics of the observing systems, particularly their averaging kernels and error covariances. We develop the methods required to do this, applicable to any kind of retrieval method, not only to optimal estimators. We show how profiles and derived quantities such as the total column of a constituent may be properly compared, yielding different averaging kernels. We find that the effect of different averaging kernels can be reduced if the retrieval or the derived quantity of one instrument is simulated using the retrieval of the other. We also show how combinations of measured signals can be found, which can be compared directly. To illustrate these methods, we apply them to two real instruments, calculating the expected amplitudes and variabilities of the diagnostics for a comparison of CO measurements made by a ground-based Fourier Transform spectrometer (FTIR) and the {\^{a}}{\oe}measurement of pollution in the troposphere{\^{a}} instrument (MOPITT), which is mounted on the EOS Terra platform. The main conclusions for this case are the following: (1) Direct comparison of retrieved profiles is not satisfactory, because the expected standard deviation of the difference is around half of the expected natural variability of the true atmospheric profiles. (2) Comparison of the MOPITT profile retrieval with a simulation using FTIR is much more useful, though still not ideal, with expected standard deviation of differences of around 20{\%} of the expected natural variability. (3) Direct comparison of total columns gives an expected standard deviation of about 9{\%}, while comparison of MOPITT with a simulation derived from FTIR improved this to 8{\%}. (4) There is only one combination of measured signals that can be usefully compared. The difference is expected to have a standard deviation of about 5.5{\%} of the expected natural variability, which is mostly due to noise.},

abstract = {We present a first description and evaluation of GEOS-CHEM, a global three-dimensional (3-D) model of tropospheric chemistry driven by assimilated meteorological observations from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) of the NASA Data Assimilation Office (DAO). The model is applied to a 1-year simulation of tropospheric ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon chemistry for 1994, and is evaluated with observations both for 1994 and for other years. It reproduces usually to within 10 ppb the concentrations of ozone observed from the worldwide ozonesonde data network. It simulates correctly the seasonal phases and amplitudes of ozone concentrations for different regions and altitudes, but tends to underestimate the seasonal amplitude at northern midlatitudes. Observed concentrations of NO and peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) observed in aircraft campaigns are generally reproduced to within a factor of 2 and often much better. Concentrations of HNO3 in the remote troposphere are overestimated typically by a factor of 2-3, a common problem in global models that may reflect a combination of insufficient precipitation scavenging and gas-aerosol partitioning not resolved by the model. The model yields an atmospheric lifetime of methylchloroform (proxy for global OH) of 5.1 years, as compared to a best estimate from observations of 5.5 plus or minus 0.8 years, and simulates H2O2 concentrations observed from aircraft with significant regional disagreements but no global bias. The OH concentrations are approximately 20{\%} higher than in our previous global 3-D model which included an UV-absorbing aerosol. Concentrations of CO tend to be underestimated by the model, often by 10-30 ppb, which could reflect a combination of excessive OH (a 20{\%} decrease in model OH could be accommodated by the methylchloroform constraint) and an underestimate of CO sources (particularly biogenic). The model underestimates observed acetone concentrations over the South Pacific in fall by a factor of 3; a missing source from the ocean may be implicated.},

abstract = {Methane is an important greenhouse gas, responsible for about 20{\%} of the warming induced by long-lived greenhouse gases since pre-industrial times. By reacting with hydroxyl radicals, methane reduces the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and generates ozone in the troposphere. Although most sources and sinks of methane have been identified, their relative contributions to atmospheric methane levels are highly uncertain. As such, the factors responsible for the observed stabilization of atmospheric methane levels in the early 2000s, and the renewed rise after 2006, remain unclear. Here, we construct decadal budgets for methane sources and sinks between 1980 and 2010, using a combination of atmospheric measurements and results from chemical transport models, ecosystem models, climate chemistry models and inventories of anthropogenic emissions. The resultant budgets suggest that data-driven approaches and ecosystem models overestimate total natural emissions. We build three contrasting emission scenarios — which differ in fossil fuel and microbial emissions — to explain the decadal variability in atmospheric methane levels detected, here and in previous studies, since 1985. Although uncertainties in emission trends do not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn, we show that the observed stabilization of methane levels between 1999 and 2006 can potentially be explained by decreasing-to-stable fossil fuel emissions, combined with stable-to-increasing microbial emissions. We show that a rise in natural wetland emissions and fossil fuel emissions probably accounts for the renewed increase in global methane levels after 2006, although the relative contribution of these two sources remains uncertain.},

abstract = {We present a strategy (MIR-GBM v1.0) for the retrieval of column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of methane (XCH(4)) with a precision {\textless}0.3{\%} (1-sigma diurnal variation, 7-min integration) and a seasonal bias {\textless}0.14{\%} from mid-infrared ground-based solar FTIR measurements of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC, comprising 22 FTIR stations). This makes NDACC methane data useful for satellite validation and for the inversion of regional-scale sources and sinks in addition to long-term trend analysis. Such retrievals complement the high accuracy and precision near-infrared observations of the younger Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) with time series dating back 15 years or so before TCCON operations began. MIR-GBM v1.0 is using HITRAN 2000 (including the 2001 update release) and 3 spectral micro windows (2613.70-2615.40 cm(-1), 2835.50-2835.80 cm(-1), 2921.00-2921.60 cm(-1)). A first-order Tikhonov constraint is applied to the state vector given in units of per cent of volume mixing ratio. It is tuned to achieve minimum diurnal variation without damping seasonality. Final quality selection of the retrievals uses a threshold for the goodness of fit (chi(2) {\textless} 1) as well as for the ratio of root-mean-square spectral noise and information content ({\textless}0.15 {\%}). Column-averaged dry-air mole fractions are calculated using the retrieved methane profiles and four-times-daily pressure-temperature-humidity profiles from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) interpolated to the time of measurement. MIR-GBM v1.0 is the optimum of 24 tested retrieval strategies (8 different spectral micro-window selections, 3 spectroscopic line lists: HITRAN 2000, 2004, 2008). Dominant errors of the non-optimum retrieval strategies are systematic HDO/H(2)O-CH(4) interference errors leading to a seasonal bias up to approximate to 5 {\%}. Therefore interference errors have been quantified at 3 test sites covering clear-sky integrated water vapor levels representative for all NDACC sites (Wollongong maximum = 44.9 mm, Garmisch mean = 14.9 mm, Zugspitze minimum = 0.2 mm). The same quality ranking of the 24 strategies was found for all 3 test sites with one optimum, i.e. MIR-GBM v1.0. Seasonality of XCH(4) above the Zugspitze (47 degrees N) shows a minus-sine shape with a minimum in March/April, a maximum in September, and an amplitude of 16.2 +/- 2.9 ppb (0.94 +/- 0.17 {\%}). This agrees well with the WFM-DOAS v2.0 scientific XCH(4) retrieval product. A conclusion from this paper is that improved spectroscopic parameters for CH(4), HDO, and H(2)O in the 2613-2922 cm(-1) spectral domain are urgently needed. If such become available with sufficient accuracy, at least two more spectral micro windows could be utilized leading to another improvement in precision. The absolute inter-calibration of NDACC MIR-GBM v1.0 XCH(4) to TCCON data is subject of ongoing work},

abstract = {We present the new version (v14) of the BIRA-IASB algorithm for the retrieval of formaldehyde (H2CO) columns from spaceborne UV-Visible sensors. Applied to OMI measurements from Aura and to GOME-2 measurements from MetOp-A and B, this algorithm is used to produce global distributions of H2CO representative of mid-morning and early afternoon conditions. Its main features include (1) a new iterative DOAS scheme involving three fitting intervals to better account for the O2-O2 absorption, (2) the use of earthshine radiances averaged in the equatorial Pacific as reference spectra, (3) a destriping correction and background normalisation resolved in the along-swath position. For the air mass factor calculation, a priori vertical profiles calculated by the IMAGES chemistry transport model at 9.30 a.m. and 13.30 p.m. are used. Although the resulting GOME-2 and OMI H2CO vertical columns are found to be highly correlated, some systematic differences are observed. Afternoon columns are generally larger than morning ones, especially in mid-latitude regions. In contrast, over tropical rainforests, morning H2CO columns significantly exceed those observed in the afternoon. These differences are discussed in terms of the H2CO column variation between mid-morning and early afternoon, using ground-based MAX-DOAS measurements available from seven stations in Europe, China and Africa. Validation results confirm the capacity of the combined satellite measurements to resolve diurnal variations in H2CO columns. Furthermore, vertical profiles derived from MAX-DOAS measurements in the Beijing area and in Bujumbura are used for a more detailed validation exercise. In both regions, we find an agreement better than 15{\%} when MAX-DOAS profiles are used as a priori for the satellite retrievals. Finally regional trends in H2CO columns are estimated for the 2004–2014 period using SCIAMACHY and GOME-2 data for morning conditions, and OMI for early afternoon conditions. Consistent features are observed such as an increase of the columns in India and Central-East China, and a decrease in Eastern US and Europe. We find that the higher horizontal resolution of OMI combined to a better sampling and a more favourable illumination at mid-day allow for more significant trend estimates, especially over Europe and North America. Importantly, in some parts of the Amazonian forest, we observe with both time series a significant downward trend in H2CO columns, spatially correlated with areas affected by deforestation.},

abstract = {Methane and ethane are the most abundant hydrocarbons in the atmosphere and they affect both atmospheric chemistry and climate. Both gases are emitted from fossil fuels and biomass burning, whereas methane (CH(4)) alone has large sources from wetlands, agriculture, landfills and waste water. Here we use measurements in firn (perennial snowpack) air from Greenland and Antarctica to reconstruct the atmospheric variability of ethane (C(2)H(6)) during the twentieth century. Ethane levels rose from early in the century until the 1980s, when the trend reversed, with a period of decline over the next 20 years. We find that this variability was primarily driven by changes in ethane emissions from fossil fuels; these emissions peaked in the 1960s and 1970s at 14-16 teragrams per year (1 Tg = 10(12) g) and dropped to 8-10 Tg yr(-1) by the turn of the century. The reduction in fossil-fuel sources is probably related to changes in light hydrocarbon emissions associated with petroleum production and use. The ethane-based fossil-fuel emission history is strikingly different from bottom-up estimates of methane emissions from fossil-fuel use, and implies that the fossil-fuel source of methane started to decline in the 1980s and probably caused the late twentieth century slow-down in the growth rate of atmospheric methane.},

abstract = {A new one-decade (1997-2006) dataset of formaldehyde (HCHO) columns retrieved from GOME and SCIAMACHY is compared with HCHO columns simulated by an updated version of the IMAGES global chemical transport model. This model version includes an optimized chemical scheme with respect to HCHO production, where the short-term and final HCHO yields from pyrogenically emitted non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are estimated from the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) and an explicit speciation profile of pyrogenic emissions. The model is driven by the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) version 1 or 2 for biomass burning, whereas biogenic emissions are provided either by the Global Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA), or by a newly developed inventory based on the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) algorithms driven by meteorological fields from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The comparisons focus on tropical ecosystems, North America and China, which experience strong biogenic and biomass burning NMVOC emissions reflected in the enhanced measured HCHO columns. These comparisons aim at testing the ability of the model to reproduce the observed features of the HCHO distribution on the global scale and at providing a first assessment of the performance of the current emission inventories. The high correlation coefficients (r{\textgreater}0.7) between the observed and simulated columns over most regions indicate a good consistency between the model, the implemented inventories and the HCHO dataset. The use of the MEGAN-ECMWF inventory improves the model/data agreement in almost all regions, but biases persist over parts of Africa and Australia. Although neither GFED version is consistent with the data over all regions, a better agreement is achieved over Indonesia and Southern Africa when GFEDv2 is used, but GFEDv1 succeeds better in getting the correct seasonal patterns and intensities of the fire episodes over the Amazon basin, as reflected in the significantly higher correlations calculated in this region. Although the uncertainties in the HCHO retrievals, especially over fire scenes, can be quite large, this study provides a first assessment about whether the improved methodologies and input data implemented in GFEDv2 and MEGAN-ECMWF lead to better results in the comparisons of modelled with observed HCHO column measurements.},

abstract = {[1] We present a study of the sensitivity of isoprene emission calculations in a global chemistry transport model (CTM) to input land cover characteristics and analyze the impacts of changes in isoprene on the tropospheric budgets of atmospheric key species. The CTM Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Species, version 4 (MOZART-4) includes the online calculation of isoprene emissions based on the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN), which is driven by three different land parameter inputs. We also included a tagging scheme in the CTM, which keeps track of the production of carbon containing species from isoprene oxidation. It is found that the amount of tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde ( HCHO) and peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) explained by isoprene oxidation ranges from 9-16{\%}, 15-27{\%}, and 22-32{\%}, depending on the isoprene emissions scenario. Changes in the global tropospheric burden with different land cover inputs can reach up to 10{\%} for CO, 15{\%} for HCHO, and 20{\%} for PAN. Changes for ozone are small on a global scale, but regionally differences are as large as 3DU in the tropospheric column and as large as 5 ppbv in the surface concentrations. Our results demonstrate that a careful integration of isoprene emissions and chemistry in CTMs is very important for simulating the budgets of a number of atmospheric trace gases. We further demonstrate that the model tagging scheme has the capability of improving conventional methods of constraining isoprene emissions from space-borne HCHO column observations, especially in regions where a considerable part of the variability in the HCHO column is not related to isoprene.},

abstract = {The biogenic emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes are one of the main drivers of atmospheric photochemistry, including oxidant and secondary organic aerosol production. In this paper, the emission rates of isoprene and monoterpenes from Australian vegetation are investigated for the first time using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1 (MEGANv2.1), the CSIRO chemical transport model, and atmospheric observations of isoprene, monoterpenes and isoprene oxidation products (methacrolein and methyl-vinyl-ketone). Observations from four field campaigns during three different seasons are used, covering urban, coastal suburban and inland forest areas. The observed concentrations of isoprene and monoterpenes were of a broadly similar magnitude, which may indicate that southeast Australia holds an unusual position where neither chemical species dominates. The model results overestimate the observed atmospheric concentrations of isoprene (up to a factor of 6) and underestimate the monoterpene concentrations (up to a factor of 4). This may occur because the emission rates currently used in MEGANv2.1 for Australia are drawn mainly from young Eucalypt trees (},

abstract = {New burned area datasets and top-down constraints from atmospheric concentration measurements of pyrogenic gases have decreased the large uncertainty in fire emissions estimates. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the contribution of deforestation, savanna, forest, agricultural waste, and peat fires to total global fire emissions. Here we used a revised version of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model and improved satellite-derived estimates of area burned, fire activity, and plant productivity to calculate fire emissions for the 19972009 period on a 0.5 spatial resolution with a monthly time step. For November 2000 onwards, estimates were based on burned area, active fire detections, and plant productivity from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. For the partitioning we focused on the MODIS era. We used maps of burned area derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) active fire data prior to MODIS (19972000) and estimates of plant productivity derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations during the same period. Average global fire carbon emissions according to this version 3 of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED3) were 2.0 Pg C year1 with significant interannual variability during 19972001 (2.8 Pg C year1 in 1998 and 1.6 Pg C year1 in 2001). Globally, emissions during 20022007 were relatively constant (around 2.1 Pg C year1) before declining in 2008 (1.7 Pg C year1) and 2009 (1.5 Pg C year1) partly due to lower deforestation fire emissions in South America and tropical Asia. On a regional basis, emissions were highly variable during 20022007 (e.g., boreal Asia, South America, and Indonesia), but these regional differences canceled out at a global level. During the MODIS era (20012009), most carbon emissions were from fires in grasslands and savannas (44{\%}) with smaller contributions from tropical deforestation and degradation fires (20{\%}), woodland fires (mostly confined to the tropics, 16{\%}), forest fires (mostly in the extratropics, 15{\%}), agricultural waste burning (3{\%}), and tropical peat fires (3{\%}). The contribution from agricultural waste fires was likely a lower bound because our approach for measuring burned area could not detect all of these relatively small fires. Total carbon emissions were on average 13{\%} lower than in our previous (GFED2) work. For reduced trace gases such as CO and CH4, deforestation, degradation, and peat fires were more important contributors because of higher emissions of reduced trace gases per unit carbon combusted compared to savanna fires. Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation, degradation, and peatland fires were on average 0.5 Pg C year1. The carbon emissions from these fires may not be balanced by regrowth following fire. Our results provide the first global assessment of the contribution of different sources to total global fire emissions for the past decade, and supply the community with an improved 13-year fire emissions time series.},

abstract = {We analyse the carbon monoxide (CO), ethane (C2H6) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) partial columns (from the ground to 12 km) derived from measurements by ground-based solar Fourier Transform Spectroscopy at Lauder, New Zealand (45 degrees S, 170 degrees E), and at Arrival Heights, Antarctica (78 degrees S, 167 degrees E), from 1997 to 2009. Significant negative trends are calculated for all species at both locations, based on the daily-mean observed time series, namely CO (-0.94 +/- 0.47{\%} yr(-1)), C2H6 (-2.37 +/- 1.18{\%} yr(-1)) and HCN (-0.93 +/- 0.47{\%} yr(-1)) at Lauder and CO (-0.92 +/- 0.46{\%} yr(-1)), C2H6 (-2.82 +/- 1.37{\%} yr(-1)) and HCN (-1.41 +/- 0.71{\%} yr(-1)) at Arrival Heights. The uncertainties reflect the 95{\%} confidence limits. However, the magnitudes of the trends are influenced by the anomaly associated with the 1997-1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation event at the beginning of the time series reported. We calculate trends for each month from 1997 to 2009 and find negative trends for all months. The largest monthly trends of CO and C2H6 at Lauder, and to a lesser degree at Arrival Heights, occur during austral spring during the Southern Hemisphere tropical and subtropical biomass burning period. For HCN, the largest monthly trends occur in July and August at Lauder and around November at Arrival Heights. The correlations between CO and C2H6 and between CO and HCN at Lauder in September to November, when the biomass burning maximizes, are significantly larger that those in other seasons. A tropospheric chemistry-climate model is used to simulate CO, C2H6, and HCN partial columns for the period of 1997-2009, using interannually varying biomass burning emissions from GFED3 and annually periodic but seasonally varying emissions from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources. The model-simulated partial columns of these species compare well with the measured partial columns and the model accurately reproduces seasonal cycles of all three species at both locations. However, while the model satisfactorily captures both the seasonality and trends in HCN, it is not able to reproduce the negative trends in either C2H6 or CO. A further simulation assuming a 35{\%} decline of C2H6 and a 26{\%} decline of CO emissions from the industrial sources from 1997 to 2009 largely captures the observed trends of C2H6 and CO partial columns at both locations. Here we attribute trends in HCN exclusively to changes in biomass burning and thereby isolate the influence of anthropogenic emissions as responsible for the long-term decline in CO and C2H6. This analysis shows that biomass burning emissions are the main factors in controlling the interannual and seasonal variations of these species. We also demonstrate contributions of biomass burning emission from different southern tropical and sub-tropical regions to seasonal and interannual variations of CO at Lauder; it shows that long-range transport of biomass burning emissions from southern Africa and South America have consistently larger year-to-year contributions to the background seasonality of CO at Lauder than those from other regions (e.g. Australia and South-East Asia). However, large interannual anomalies are triggered by variations in biomass burning emissions associated with large-scale El Nino Southern Oscillation and prolonged biomass burning events, e.g. the Australian bush fires.},

abstract = {Formaldehyde (HCHO) column data from satellites are widely used as a proxy for emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but validation of the data has been extremely limited. Here we use highly accurate HCHO aircraft observations from the NASA SEAC4RS campaign over the Southeast US in August–September 2013 to validate and intercompare six operational and research retrievals of HCHO columns from four different satellite instruments (OMI, GOME2A, GOME2B and OMPS) and three different research groups. The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model provides a common intercomparison platform. We find that all retrievals capture the HCHO maximum over Arkansas and Louisiana, reflecting high emissions of biogenic isoprene, and are consistent in their spatial variability over the Southeast US (r = 0.4–0.8 on a 0.5° × 0.5° grid) as well as their day-to-day variability (r = 0.5–0.8). However, all satellite retrievals are biased low in the mean by 20–51 {\%}, which would lead to corresponding bias in estimates of isoprene emissions from the satellite data. The smallest bias is for OMI-BIRA, which has the highest corrected slant columns and the lowest scattering weights in its air mass factor (AMF) calculation. Correcting the assumed HCHO vertical profiles (shape factors) used in the AMF calculation would further reduce the bias in the OMI-BIRA data. We conclude that current satellite HCHO data provide a reliable proxy for isoprene emission variability but with a low mean bias due both to the corrected slant columns and the scattering weights used in the retrievals.},

abstract = {Multiple simulations from nine globally coupled climate models were assessed for their ability to reproduce observed trends in a set of indices representing temperature and precipitation extremes over Australia. Observed trends over the period 1957–1999 were compared with individual and multi-modelled trends calculated over the same period. When averaged across Australia, the magnitude of trends and interannual variability of temperature extremes were well simulated by most models, particularly for the index for warm nights. The majority of models also reproduced the correct sign of trend for precipitation extremes although there was much more variation between the individual model runs. A bootstrapping technique was used to calculate uncertainty estimates and also to verify that most model runs produce plausible trends when averaged over Australia. Although very few showed significant skill at reproducing the observed spatial pattern of trends, a pattern correlation measure showed that spatial noise could not be ruled out as dominating these patterns. Two of the models with output from different forcings showed that the observed trends over Australia for one of the temperature indices was consistent with an anthropogenic response, but was inconsistent with natural-only forcings. Future projected changes in extremes using three emissions scenarios were also analysed. Australia shows a shift towards warming of temperature extremes, particularly a significant increase in the number of warm nights and heat waves with much longer dry spells interspersed with periods of increased extreme precipitation, irrespective of the scenario used.

abstract = {Isoprene emissions from the leaves of velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens L. var utilis) plants exhibited temperature response patterns that were dependent on the plant's growth temperature. Plants grown in a warm regimen (34/28 degrees C, day/night) exhibited a temperature optimum for emissions of 45 degrees C, whereas those grown in a cooler regimen (26/20 degrees C, day/night) exhibited an optimum of 40 degrees C. Several previous studies have provided evidence of a linkage between isoprene emissions and photosynthesis, and more recent studies have demonstrated that isoprene emissions are linked to the activity of isoprene synthase in plant leaves. To further explore this linkage within the context of the temperature dependence of isoprene emissions, we determined the relative temperature dependencies of photosynthetic electron transport, CO(2) assimilation, and isoprene synthase activity. When measured over a broad range of temperatures, the temperature dependence of isoprene emission rate was not closely correlated with either the electron transport rate or the CO(2) assimilation rate. The temperature optima for electron transport rate and CO(2) assimilation rate were 5 to 10 degrees C lower than that for the isoprene emission rate. The dependence of isoprene emissions on photon flux density was also affected by measurement temperature in a pattern independent of those exhibited for electron transport rate and CO(2) assimilation rate. Thus, despite no change in the electron transport rate or CO(2) assimilation rate at 26 and 34 degrees C, the isoprene emission rate changed markedly. The quantum yield of isoprene emissions was stimulated by a temperature increase from 26 to 34 degrees C, whereas the quantum yield for CO(2) assimilation was inhibited. In greenhouse-grown aspen leaves (Populus tremuloides Michaux.), the high temperature threshold for inhibition of isoprene emissions was closely correlated with the high temperature-induced decrease in the in vitro activity of isoprene synthase. When taken together, the results indicate that although there may be a linkage between isoprene emission rate and photosynthesis, the temperature dependence of isoprene emission is not determined solely by the rates of CO(2) assimilation or electron transport. Rather, we propose that regulation is accomplished primarily through the enzyme isoprene synthase.},

abstract = {Numerical assessments of global air quality and potential changes in atmospheric chemical constituents require estimates of the surface fluxes of a variety of trace gas species. We have developed a global model to estimate emissions of volatile organic compounds from natural sources (NVOC). Methane is not considered here and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere. The model has a highly resolved spatial grid (0.5° × 0.5° latitude/longitude) and generates hourly average emission estimates. Chemical species are grouped into four categories: isoprene, monoterpenes, other reactive VOC (ORVOC), and other VOC (OVOC). NVOC emissions from oceans are estimated as a function of geophysical variables from a general circulation model and ocean color satellite data. Emissions from plant foliage are estimated from ecosystem specific biomass and emission factors and algorithms describing light and temperature dependence of NVOC emissions. Foliar density estimates are based on climatic variables and satellite data. Temporal variations in the model are driven by monthly estimates of biomass and temperature and hourly light estimates. The annual global VOC flux is estimated to be 1150 Tg C, composed of 44{\%} isoprene, 11{\%} monoterpenes, 22.5{\%} other reactive VOC, and 22.5{\%} other VOC. Large uncertainties exist for each of these estimates and particularly for compounds other than isoprene and monoterpenes. Tropical woodlands (rain forest, seasonal, drought-deciduous, and savanna) contribute about half of all global natural VOC emissions. Croplands, shrublands and other woodlands contribute 10–20{\%} apiece. Isoprene emissions calculated for temperate regions are as much as a factor of 5 higher than previous estimates.},

abstract = {Smoke plumes from fires contain atmospheric pollutants that can be transported to populated areas and effect regional air quality. In this paper, the characteristics and impact of the fire plumes from a major fire event that occurred in October 2013 (17-26) in the New South Wales (NSW) in Australia, near the populated areas of Sydney and Wollongong, are studied. Measurements from the Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometer located at the University of Wollongong allowed a calculation of specific emission factors (EFs) in terms of grams per kilogram of dry fuel burned: 1640 g kg-1 of carbon dioxide; 107 g kg-1 of carbon monoxide; 7.8 g kg-1 of methane and 0.16 g kg-1 of nitrous oxide. These EFs have then been used to calculate daily fire emissions for the NSW fire event using the APIFLAME emissions' model, leading to an increase of 54{\%} of CO emitted compared to calculations with EFs from Akagi et al. (2011), widely used in the literature. Simulations have been conducted for this event using the regional chemistry-transport model (CTM) CHIMERE, allowing the first evaluation of its regional impact. Fire emissions are assumed well mixed into the boundary layer. The model simulations have been evaluated compared to measurements at the NSW air quality stations. The mean correlation coefficients (R) are 0.44 for PM10, 0.60 for PM2.5 and 0.79 for CO, with a negative bias for CO (-14{\%}) and a positive bias for PM2.5 (64{\%}). The model shows higher performance for lower boundary layer heights and wind speeds. According to the observations, 7 days show concentrations exceeding the air quality Australian national standards for PM10, 8 days for PM2.5. In the simulations, 5 days are correctly simulated for PM10, 8 days for PM2.5. For PM10, the model predicts 1 additional day of exceedance (one false detection). During this fire episode, inner Sydney is affected during 5 days by PM exceedances, that are mainly attributed to organic carbon in the model simulations.To evaluate the influence of the diurnal variability and the injection heights of fire emissions, two additional simulations were performed: one with all fire emissions injected below 1 km (CHIM{\_}1 km), since satellite observations suggest low injection for this fire case, and one with a diurnal profile (CHIM{\_}diu) adjusted to best match surface observations closest to the fires. CHIM{\_}1 km displays less bias and root mean square error, and CHIM{\_}diu presents a good agreement for hourly statistics for stations where peaks of PM are well captured, but enhances the differences when a peak is overestimated by the model. This sensitivity analysis highlights significant uncertainties related to these two key fire parameters (which add up to uncertainties on emissions), resulting in variations on concentrations of PM and CO.},

abstract = {Formaldehyde columns retrieved from the Scanning Imaging Absorption$\backslash$nSpectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography/Chemistry (SCIAMACHY)$\backslash$ninstrument on-board ENVISAT satellite through 2003 to 2006 are used as$\backslash$ntop-down constraints to derive updated global biogenic and biomass$\backslash$nburning flux estimates for the non-methane volatile organic compounds$\backslash$n(NMVOCs) precursors of formaldehyde. Our interest is centered over$\backslash$nregions experiencing strong emissions, and hence exhibiting a high$\backslash$nsignal-to-noise ratio and lower measurement uncertainties. The$\backslash$nformaldehyde dataset used in this study has been recently made available$\backslash$nto the community and complements the long record of formaldehyde$\backslash$nmeasurements from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME). We use$\backslash$nthe IMAGESv2 global chemistry-transport model driven by the Global Fire$\backslash$nEmissions Database (GFED) version 1 or 2 for biomass burning, and from$\backslash$nthe newly developed MEGAN-ECMWF isoprene emission database. The adjoint$\backslash$nof the model is implemented in a grid-based framework within which$\backslash$nemission fluxes are derived at the model resolution, together with a$\backslash$ndifferentiation of the sources in a grid cell. Two inversion studies are$\backslash$nconducted using either the GFEDv1 or GFEDv2 as a priori for the$\backslash$npyrogenic fluxes. Although on the global scale the inferred emissions$\backslash$nfrom the two categories exhibit only weak deviations from the$\backslash$ncorresponding a priori estimates, the regional updates often present$\backslash$nlarge departures from their a priori values. The posterior isoprene$\backslash$nemissions over North America, amounting to about 34 Tg C/yr, are$\backslash$nestimated to be on average by 25{\%} lower than the a priori over$\backslash$n2003-2006, whereas a strong increase (55{\%}) is deduced over the south$\backslash$nAfrican continent, the optimized emission being estimated at 57 Tg C/yr.$\backslash$nOver Indonesia the biogenic emissions appear to be overestimated by$\backslash$n20-30{\%}, whereas over Indochina and the Amazon basin during the wet$\backslash$nseason the a priori inventory captures both the seasonality and the$\backslash$nmagnitude of the observed columns. Although neither biomass burning$\backslash$ninventory seems to be consistent with the data over all regions,$\backslash$npyrogenic estimates inferred from the two inversions are reasonably$\backslash$nsimilar, despite their a priori deviations. A number of sensitivity$\backslash$nexperiments are conducted in order to assess the impact of uncertainties$\backslash$nrelated to the inversion setup and the chemical mechanism. Whereas$\backslash$nchanges in the background error covariance matrix have only a limited$\backslash$nimpact on the posterior fluxes, the use of an alternative isoprene$\backslash$nmechanism characterized by lower HCHO yields (the GEOS-Chem mechanism)$\backslash$nincreases the posterior isoprene source estimate by 11{\%} over northern$\backslash$nAmerica, and by up to 40{\%} in tropical regions.},
